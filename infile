4.1. terminology
4.1.1. platter, head, track, cylinder, sector
Data is commonly stored on magnetic or optical disk platt
ers. The platters are rotated (at high speeds). 
Data is read by heads, which are very close to the surface of the platter, without touching it! 
The heads
 are mounted on an arm (sometimes called a comb or a fork).
Data is written in concentric circles called tracks. Track zero is (usually) on the outside. Th
e time it 
takes to position the head over a certa
in track is called the seek time. Often the platters are stacked 
on top of each other, hence the set of tr
acks accessible at a certain position of the comb forms a cylin
der. Tracks are divided into 512 byte secto
rs, with more unused space (gap) between the sectors on the 
outside of the platter.
When you break down the advertised access time of 
a hard drive, you will notice that most of that time i
s taken by movement of the heads (about 65%) and rotational latency (about 30%).
4.1.2. ide or scsi
Actually, the title should be ata or scsi, s
ince ide is an ata compatible device. Most desktops use ata 
devices, most servers use scsi.
4.1.3. ata
An ata controller allows two devices per bus,
 one master and one slave. Unless your controller and devic
es support cable select, you have to set this manually with jumpers.
With the introduction of sata (serial ata), the original ata was renamed to parallel ata. Optical drives 
often use atapi, which is an ATA interface using the SCSI communication protocol.
4.1.4. scsi
A scsi controller allows more than two devices. When using SCSI (small com
puter system interface), each 
device gets a 
unique scsi id. Th
e scsi controller al
so needs a scsi id, do not
 use this id for a scsi-attach
 ed device.
Older 8-bit SCSI is now called na
rrow, whereas 16-bit is wide. When th
e bus speeds was doubled to 10Mhz,
 this was known as fast SCSI. Doubling to 20Mhz made it ultra SCSI. Take a look
  at http://en.wikipedia.o
 rg/wiki/SCSI for more SCSI standards.
